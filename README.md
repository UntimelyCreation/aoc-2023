# Advent of Code 2023

Solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 problems, written in Go.

This is my first project using Go: I intend to learn and practice the language instead of optimizing the solutions.


## Usage

### Prerequisites

This project makes use of **Go 1.21**.


### Build and run solutions

The repository is structured into subdirectories, each one named after the corresponding day in the calendar and containing a main file `main.go`.

In a given subdirectory, place the corresponding input in a `.txt` file, and adjust its path in the `main.go` file accordingly.

Then, simply run the `main.go` file.

For example, to produce the solutions for Day 1:

```bash
go run 01/main.go
```
